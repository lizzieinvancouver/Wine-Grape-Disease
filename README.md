Wine Grape Disease

Two main analyses

1. a collection of wine grape diseases that affect only agricultural hosts

Progress: List is almost complete except for a few species, need to add and research impacts, synonyms and hosts. Will put information in orginal excel sheet 


2. focusing on one particular pathogen and using all the affected hosts

Progress: Focussing on Botryoshaeriacwhich has 21 species known to infect grapevines and 1112 hosts!


Ideas

1. species further away from their native range do more damage

2. Climate change will favour some species over others

3. Species with multiple ways to spread are more successful 

4. Coinfections of diseases is important

5. Which group (bacteria, virus, fungal or pest) is the worst for wine grapes


Impact
-Measured in either $ or % yield loss
-Some diseases more studies than others based on web of science searches for all synomyms 

github repo made (does Jonathan have a github ID, will need to find out)

github has all the cleaning code, synonym information, orginial excel sheet and sources 


Analyses
Phylogeny used is from  Zanne et al. 
taxa have been matched
need to figure out how to narrow down hosts to those only in the phylogeny rather than assuming all genus is affected if it has a SP.
